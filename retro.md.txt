Retrospective techniques

Start, Stop, Continue, More of, Less of Wheel is a retrospective technique, where you ask the following questions: What should we start doing that we haven't done yet? What should we stop doing that is not contributing or is getting in our way? What is working that we want to continue to do? What should we do more of and what should we do less of? Answers to these questions are written on a circle drawn on a poster that is divided into five sectors, one sector for each question. This feedback is obtained in short(10-25min) discussions among the team after one iteration or the whole project. Variation for bigger groups and longer periods incluces working in groups that each draw their own circle and later also contibute to other groups' circles.
Glad, sad, mad is a bit longer retrospective technique (60 min). Notes of observations of the previous sprin are gathered from the group, both positive and negative. 10 minutes is given to write these down on index cards. The cards are put up on a whiteboard in three categories: things that make you glad, sad or mad. Cards are then grouped, so that issues referring to same things are moved together and people can vote on which issues they would like to talk about. Then a discussion is carried about the issues starting from those that have gained the most votes eventually proceeding to those that have the least votes until the time is up or all issues have been discussed.
